The is a guessing app.
You open the app and it welcomes you,
Then it automatcally lead you to the activity,
The app randomly chooses a number,
Which you will guess,
It is a number below 100,
For whatever number you choose, 
According to the digits, it will either tell you lower or Higher.
Meaning you either chose a number too low or too high from what the actual number is.
And so you should either choose a number lwer than what you chose or lower.
and so you guess again till it tells you "Correct"
