You open the app and it welcomes you,
Then it automatcally lead you to the activity,
The app randomly chooses a number,
Which you will guess,
It is a number below 100,
If you dont chose the correct number,
According to the digit you choose it will either tell you higher or lower.
Meaning you either choosed a number too low or too high from what the actual number is.
